# Jarvis-The-Collaborative-AI-Agent
Jarvis is an interactive AI collaboration agent built using the Gemini API. It can co-create creative content (stories, ideas, etc.) and also debug code / solve analytical tasks by detecting the type of user input. Includes a small intentionally-bugged Python script to test the agent’s debugging ability.
